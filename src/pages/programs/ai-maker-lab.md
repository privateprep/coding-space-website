  title: AI Maker Lab
  description: AI Maker Lab is a hands-on course where middle schoolers combine
    coding and AI tools to build a portfolio of creative, thoughtful projects.
    Students train simple machine learning models, use AI-generated art or music
    in their games, and experiment with physical tools like micro:bit to see how
    AI learns from real-world data. It's an exciting, age-appropriate way to
    understand how AI works and how to use it responsibly.

      ## **AI Maker Lab**


      **Where coding, creativity, and artificial intelligence come together.**


      Middle schoolers are already using AI. Now they'll learn how it actually works. In AI Maker Lab, students explore the building blocks of artificial intelligence through hands-on coding projects, simple machine-learning tools, generative AI art and music, and even real-world data from micro:bit sensors. 


      Throughout the course, students create a portfolio of interactive, meaningful projects that show how AI can recognize patterns, make predictions, and enhance their own creative ideas. Along the way, they also learn about responsible AI use, data ethics, and what it really means to “teach” a model.


      Whether they're training an image classifier, adding AI-generated music to a game, or experimenting with sensor data to teach a model how to respond to the environment, students get a fun, age-appropriate introduction to the world of AI. No prior coding experience required.
