  title: AI Maker Lab
  description: AI Maker Lab is a hands-on course where middle schoolers combine
    coding and AI tools to build a portfolio of creative, thoughtful projects.
    Students train simple machine learning models, use AI-generated art or music
    in their games, and experiment with physical tools like micro:bit to see how
    AI learns from real-world data. It's an exciting, age-appropriate way to
    understand how AI works and how to use it responsibly.

      ***Where coding, creativity, and artificial intelligence come together.***


      Middle schoolers are already using AI, but do they understand how it works, how to create with it, and how to use it responsibly?


      **AI Maker Lab** gives students a hands-on, age-appropriate introduction to artificial intelligence through coding, data, and creative projects. 


      Throughout the course, students create a portfolio of interactive, meaningful projects that show how AI can recognize patterns, make predictions, and enhance their own creative ideas. Along the way, they also learn about responsible AI use, data ethics, and what it really means to “teach” a model.

      ## **Create with Cutting-Edge Tools**


      Students explore how AI actually works by *building with it*.\

      They use fun, accessible tools such as:


      * **Teachable Machine** → train image/sound models

      * **Machine Learning for Kids** → build text-based models

      * **AI art + music generators** → design characters, worlds, and sound

      * **micro:bit Create AI** → train models using real sensor data

      * **Lovable** → create simple AI agents with personality


      All while learning *why* AI behaves the way it does and *how* to use it responsibly.
