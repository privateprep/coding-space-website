  title: AI Maker Lab
  description: AI Maker Lab is a hands-on course where middle schoolers combine
    coding and AI tools to build a portfolio of creative, thoughtful projects.
    Students train simple machine learning models, use AI-generated art or music
    in their games, and experiment with physical tools like micro:bit to see how
    AI learns from real-world data. It's an exciting, age-appropriate way to
    understand how AI works and how to use it responsibly.
