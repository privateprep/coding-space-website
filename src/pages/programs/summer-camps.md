      ## A Summer of Learning, Creativity, and Confidence


      Camp Coding Space gives kids the opportunity to build real technology skills while having a summer they’re excited about. Held Monday through Friday throughout the summer on the Upper East Side, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and in Port Washington, Long Island, our camps combine hands-on learning, collaboration, and movement in a fun, supportive environment.


      Each day is thoughtfully designed to keep students engaged, curious, and motivated, while helping them develop skills that last far beyond the summer.

      ## Not Your Typical Coding Camp


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers, learners, and leaders.

    list:
      - title: Easily the best coding camp in NYC - actually teaches coding with
          engaged, hands-on instruction, rather than throwing kids in a computer
          lab to fend for themselves all day as many other camps do. Staff are
          friendly and attentive, and booking - even last-minute - is easy and
          efficient. My camper learned a ton of new skills and had a lot of fun
          doing it. Thanks for a great summer!

      - title: “I love coding camp! My favorite part was visiting Samsung and Apple. I
          felt like a professional coder.”
        content: Mylo, Brooklyn Camper
      - title: I was impressed by how much one-on-one feedback James received. I really
          liked the fact that the camp counselors didn't tell him what to do,
          but rather encouraged him to problem solve on his own.
        content: Tricia, NYC Parent
      - title: We are with The Coding Space for the 3rd year and it's been a great
          journey into coding together! Kids start with Scratch (building blocks
          of coding), then move onto WoofJS (JavaScript) and after that start
          coding on Python. They build valuable skills that empower them in
          their further educational and working life, I can't be happier with
          the Coding Space!
        content: Elena, NYC Parent
      - title: Attending The Coding Space again was an incredible experience! I love the
          activities as well as the instructors who are knowledgeable,
          supportive and kind. I gained valuable skills in coding that I feel
          confident in. The collaborative environment made learning enjoyable
          and effective. I highly recommend this camp to anyone looking to
          enhance their coding skills and connect with a community of
          like-minded individuals. It was truly a transformative and fun
          experience!
        content: Bryce, NYC Camper
      - title: I can't say enough good things about The Coding Space! My ten-year-old
          had an absolutely fantastic time during their two-week camp. From
          coding projects to STEM activities, every part of the program was
          engaging and well-organized. The field trip was a highlight, adding an
          extra layer of excitement to the experience.  The camp counselors were
          incredible—both fun and professional, creating an environment where my
          son felt excited and motivated every day. He was thrilled to be there,
          and it was clear that he was fully engaged throughout the entire
          camp.  If you’re looking for a camp that combines education with
          enjoyment in a supportive and dynamic setting, The Coding Space is the
          place to be. Highly recommend!,
