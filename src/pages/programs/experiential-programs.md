      ## GirlCode 


      ### Bridging the Gender Gap in Tech


      GirlCode offers the same high-quality curriculum as our co-ed classes, designed for students who prefer learning in a supportive, female-identifying space. These welcoming groups give students the confidence to explore coding, build meaningful friendships, and take on new challenges together. It's a fun, empowering environment where girls can stretch their skills, express themselves, and see themselves as future leaders in tech.

      ## AI Maker Lab


      #### Where coding, creativity, and artificial intelligence come together.


      Middle schoolers are already using AI, but do they understand how it works, how to create with it, and how to use it responsibly?


      AI Maker Lab gives students a hands-on, age-appropriate introduction to artificial intelligence through coding, data, and creative projects.


      Throughout the course, students create a portfolio of interactive, meaningful projects that show how AI can recognize patterns, make predictions, and enhance their own creative ideas. Along the way, they also learn about responsible AI use, data ethics, and what it really means to “teach” a model.

      ## Teen Code


      ### Experiential Learning For High School Students


      Our Teen Code program gives high school students a dedicated space to build real coding skills, take on age-appropriate projects, and explore more advanced concepts at their own pace. Whether they're new to programming or ready to deepen their experience, teens get the guidance they need to grow their confidence, strengthen problem-solving abilities, and create meaningful, independent work.

      ## STEM Leadership Program


      ### Hands-On Leadership for Tech-Minded Teens


      Designed for high school students who love tech and enjoy working with kids, STEM Leaders support our after-school coding classes as Teaching Assistants, gaining hands-on experience in leadership, classroom engagement, and real tech tools, including coding and AI platforms. Throughout the semester, students learn the Socratic teaching method, build communication and mentoring skills, and serve as role models for younger coders. It's a meaningful way to grow as a leader while contributing to our vibrant learning community.
