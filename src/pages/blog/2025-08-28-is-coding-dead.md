description: "Every few months, a headline surfaces asking the same provocative
  question: Is coding dead? With the rise of artificial intelligence, low-code
  and no-code platforms, and increasingly automated development tools, it’s easy
  to see why people might think so. But the truth is more nuanced and a lot more
  exciting."

## The Short Answer: No.

Coding isn’t dead, and it’s not going anywhere anytime soon. Instead, coding is evolving. Just as the invention of the calculator didn’t kill math, and Photoshop didn’t kill painting, new tools don’t erase the need for coding—they shift how and why we code.

## Why People Think Coding Might Be “Dying”

1. **AI-powered development tools** – Products like GitHub Copilot can generate code on demand, reducing the need to handwrite every line.
2. **No-code/low-code platforms** – Tools like Webflow, Bubble, and Zapier allow people with little technical training to build apps, websites, and automations.
3. **Automation everywhere** – Cloud platforms now handle much of the infrastructure setup and scaling that once required specialized coding knowledge.

From the outside, this looks like the “hard parts” of coding are disappearing.

## The Reality: Coding Skills Still Matter

Even with these tools, coding is far from obsolete:

* **Problem solving over syntax** – The essence of coding isn’t typing semicolons and curly braces; it’s breaking down problems and designing logical solutions. That skill remains essential whether you’re writing raw Python or configuring a workflow in Zapier.
* **Customization and depth** – No-code tools cover common use cases, but when you need something unique or scalable, code is still the foundation.
* **Understanding how systems work** – Even if AI writes the code, developers still need to review, debug, and adapt it. Blindly trusting machine output is a recipe for disaster.

## What’s Really Happening

The bar for *entry* is lowering. Ten years ago, creating a simple website required learning HTML, CSS, and some server setup. Today, you can spin up a polished site in minutes with Wix or Squarespace. That doesn’t mean coding disappeared—it means coding got democratized.

Now, more people can *start* without coding, but those who can code have superpowers. They can bend the rules, extend the tools, and create what others can’t.

## The Future of Coding

* **AI as a collaborator** – Developers will spend less time on repetitive boilerplate and more on higher-level design and strategy.
* **Hybrid builders** – Tomorrow’s creators won’t identify strictly as “coders” or “non-coders.” They’ll be people who know when to use a drag-and-drop tool, when to lean on AI, and when to dive into raw code.
* **Coding as literacy** – Just as writing didn’t die with the typewriter or Word processor, coding is becoming a basic literacy for navigating and shaping a digital world.

## Final Take

So, is coding dead? Not at all. It’s more alive—and more accessible—than ever. What’s dying is the idea that coding is only for a select few. The future belongs to those who can think computationally, whether they’re writing code themselves, guiding AI, or orchestrating no-code tools.

In other words: coding isn’t dead. It’s just getting started.
