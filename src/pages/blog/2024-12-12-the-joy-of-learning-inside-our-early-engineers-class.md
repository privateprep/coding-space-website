  This fall, our Early Engineers class is taking off—literally and figuratively!
  Designed for preschool-aged learners, this engaging program introduces
  foundational computer science and engineering concepts through screen-free,
  hands-on activities. Young engineers are not only having fun but also building
  essential skills like critical thinking and problem-solving that will last a
  lifetime.


  Our Early Engineers class focuses on making learning exciting and accessible for children as young as three. Here’s a look at what your little learners can expect.

### **Hands-On Learning Activities That Inspire**

Our program is built around interactive, play-based learning experiences that lay the groundwork for future success in STEM fields. Here's how we’re nurturing young minds:

1. **Cultivating Pattern Recognition and Logical Thinking**\
   Using colorful geometric blocks, children learn to identify and create sequences. These exercises develop pattern recognition and logical thinking while sparking creativity.
2. **Exploring Engineering and Design Principles**\
   Through activities like constructing rockets, bridges, or racing robots, kids develop spatial awareness, modular design literacy, and essential engineering skills. These hands-on projects foster teamwork, critical thinking, and a sense of accomplishment.
3. **Problem-Solving Through Early Math and Data Visualization**\
   Early math concepts come to life as children build charts to represent data. This activity helps young engineers develop problem-solving skills and mathematical reasoning through interactive exploration.
4. **Computational Thinking Through Screen-Free Coding Adventures**\
   Through intuitive, screen-free coding tools like Indi the Robot, students are introduced to basic coding concepts. They’ll learn how cause-and-effect relationships work while navigating through obstacle courses of their own design.
5. **Exploring Circuits and Electricity**\
   Hands-on circuit-building projects using Snap Circuits demystify electronics and introduce kids to the basics of electrical engineering.

### **Why Early Engineering Matters**

At such a formative age, every new skill is a stepping stone to greater cognitive development. Through activities that blend creativity and critical thinking, children in the Early Engineers class are not just learning—they’re growing into problem-solvers and innovators.

### **Join the Fun at The Coding Space**

Our Early Engineers class is the perfect introduction to the exciting world of STEM. Whether your child is building a rocket, programming a robot, or solving a circuit puzzle, they’ll be developing skills that prepare them for future success.
