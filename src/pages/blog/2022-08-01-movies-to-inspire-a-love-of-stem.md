      # Hidden Figures


      *Rating: PG-13*


      This uplifting [film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK8xHq6dfAo) tells the untold story of three [African-American women at NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/content/katherine-johnson-biography) who were instrumental in America's space missions in the 50s and 60s. Not only does this film present a number of scientific principles in an approachable way, it’s also bound to be especially inspiring for girls and children of color. This movie’s three Black protagonists — played by Taraji P. Henderson, Octavia Butler, and Janelle Monae — model academic excellence, confidence, and a passion for STEM, and they show how unity of vision and a commitment to scientific problem-solving can help to overcome all kinds of systemic challenges.

      # The Martian


      *Rating: PG-13*


      Cool science: a contradiction in terms? Not according to thousands of moviegoers who have been mesmerized by *[The Martian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8)*, in which an astronaut (played by Matt Damon) uses his science and math skills to survive being marooned on Mars. To generate water for growing crops, he burns hydrogen in the presence of oxygen. To power up the vehicle he needs to drive to the rescue site, he attaches leftover solar panels and battery packs to his rover. Math helps him determine the battery life he’ll need to reach the rescue site, and computer skills enable him to retool an old Mars lander to communicate with Earth. Your kids will love this space thriller, in which real STEM principles and science fiction collide.

      *Rating: PG*


      Like Hidden Figures, part of *[Apollo 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtEIMC58sZo)*’s power to inspire lies in its [basis in real events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13). *Apollo 13*, starring Tom Hanks, is a family movie focusing on the lives of the astronauts on board the landmark American expedition to the moon. When numerous technical problems threaten the astronauts’ survival and the success of the mission, the brave protagonists must devise ingenious DIY solutions to land safely back on Earth. This film emphasizes the role of visionary leadership, clear communication, superior teamwork, and unrelenting courage in STEM.

      # Big Hero 6


      *Rating: PG*


      Set in the fictional tech hub of San Fransokyo, *[Big Hero 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3biFxZIJOQ)* follows the lives of brainy teens who use their ingenious inventions to become self-made superheroes. The 14 year old protagonist Hiro is a tech geek who participates in robotics projects at school and puts his brain to work in positive, practical ways. And though Big Hero 6 focuses on a group of science geeks using chemistry and engineering to battle the forces of evil, it’s also about family, loss, and the power of kindness.

      # Wall-E


      *Rating: G*


      Though this [beloved Pixar film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ1CATNbXg0) makes a point of spotlighting the dangerous effects of industrialization at all costs, it also shows the positive power of technology through its protagonist, a big-hearted and curious robot named Wall-E. As Wall-E dutifully organizes trash, cares for his pet cockroach, re-watches old musicals, falls in love with a combat robot, and travels across the galaxy, kids will learn that they can use tech to nurture the planet and care for each other.

      # Interstellar


      *Rating: PG-13*


      Sci-fi film *[Interstellar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LqzF5WauAw)* has been lauded by scientists and teachers alike for its ability to imaginatively and accurately portray complex and fascinating scientific phenomena and concepts, including black holes, gravity, wormholes, a fifth dimension, and special relativity. Set in a future in which Earth is rapidly becoming uninhabitable, the story follows former NASA pilot Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers as they travel across the galaxy to investigate a new home for mankind. Director Christopher Nolan said, “We hoped that by dramatizing science and making it something that could be entertaining for kids we might inspire some of the astronauts of tomorrow – that would be the ultimate goal of the project.”
