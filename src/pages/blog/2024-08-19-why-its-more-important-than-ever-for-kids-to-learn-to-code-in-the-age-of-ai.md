Recently, TeachAI and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) released guidance on the future of computer science education in the age of AI. They emphasized a principle we at The Coding Space know to be true: while AI can enhance learning, it cannot replace the skills and attitudes acquired when we learn to code. Moreover, as AI continues to evolve, understanding foundational coding concepts is more important than ever to be able to evaluate and modify what AI produces.

J﻿ust as learning to make sense of numbers is important to understanding math or being able to read is essential  for literacy, making sense of code is crucial to understanding the logic and structure that underpin the digital tools we use every day. This foundational knowledge helps us navigate and understand the increasingly tech-driven world around us. 

AI technologies, such as LLMs and chatbots, are built on complex algorithms and vast amounts of data. By learning to code, we gain insight into how these systems operate. Understanding the basics of coding helps demystify AI, allowing us to see beyond the surface of these technologies. By understanding code, we can learn to integrate AI tools effectively and learn to evaluate, modify, and situate what they produce into a larger system.

Furthermore, learning to code isn't just about making a game or an app. It's about building problem-solving and critical thinking muscles that will improve performance in other disciplines and many different facets of life. Coding requires us to approach complex problems logically and to break them down into steps.  It requires the use of mental modeling (designing thinking, systems thinking, symbolic thinking, functional thinking), helps us build grit and analytical skills when we can't get our code to work, and allows us to express ourselves. Coding is a creative process as much as it is technical one. While aspects of it have and will change (we have already gone from assembly code to block-based programming), the essentials have remained the same: learning to code is just the means to a greater end.
